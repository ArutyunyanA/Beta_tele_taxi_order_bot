# Telegram Taxi Bot

This project is a Telegram bot built using the `python-telegram-bot` library. It interacts with users, processes their commands, and provides useful responses in a conversational manner. The bot includes a variety of features that allow it to be extended and customized for various purposes.

## Features

- **Command Handling**: The bot processes different commands and provides responses accordingly.
- **User Interaction**: It supports user interaction via messages, buttons, and inline keyboards.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: The bot performs tasks asynchronously to handle multiple requests simultaneously.
- **Environment Configuration**: It uses `.env` for storing sensitive data like API keys and tokens.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/telegram-bot.git
    cd telegram-bot
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Create `.env` file**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
    ```bash
    TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN=your_telegram_api_token
    ```

5. **Run the bot**:
    ```bash
    python bot.py
    ```

## Usage

- **Bot Commands**: The bot supports various commands that are listed below:
    - `/start` - Starts the bot and shows a welcome message.
    - `/help` - Shows the list of available commands and how to use them.
    - [Other commands based on your bot functionality].

- **Asynchronous Operation**: The bot handles multiple requests asynchronously, ensuring fast response times even with many users.

## Project Structure

- `bot.py` - Main script for the bot that initializes and runs the Telegram bot.
- `handlers.py` - Contains all the logic for handling user commands and messages.
- `utils.py` - Helper functions used across the bot.
- `config.py` - Configuration file to handle settings like API tokens.
- `.env` - Environment variables for storing sensitive information.

## Security

- **Telegram API Token**: The bot uses an API token stored in a `.env` file to connect to Telegram's servers. Ensure the token is kept private and not exposed in public repositories.
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive information like the API token should never be hardcoded and must be stored securely in the `.env` file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `python-telegram-bot` library
- `.env` file with API token
